# Add a KMS server in your pfSense firewall appliance

Tested on 23.09-RELEASE (amd64) pfSense appliance<br>
Compiled on FreeBSD 14.0-RC4 (amd64)<br>
Using vlmcsd-svn1113-2020-03-28-Hotbird64<br>

All credit goes to Wind4 @ https://github.com/Wind4/vlmcsd which is a `KMS Emulator in C` <br><br>

### Nuts and bolts
1- KMS server `vlmcsd` is copied into the `/bin` directory <br>
2- `vlmcsd` is then chmodded to be executable <br>
3- A shell script called `kms_start.sh` is created (and chmodded) in `/usr/local/etc/rc.d` (to start service on reboot)<br><br>

### How to Install
From the pfSense web interface, `Diagnostics` --> `Command Prompt`... type<br>
`curl -L meliton.github.io/kms2pfsense.sh | sh` <br>
Then click `Execute` <br>

### Some helpful commands
From the pfSense web command prompt<br>
`netstat -an | grep 1688` to check if KMS service is running <br>
`pkill vlmcsd` to kill/stop KMS service <br>
`vlmcsd -h` for a list of options <br>
`vlmcsd -V` for the KMS server version <br>

NOTE: If you stop the service, you'll need to restart the firewall or SSH into the box to restart with `vlmcsd` command. <br>
Typing `vlmcsd` from the GUI command prompt does not work. <br>

### Compile from scratch recipe
Download then install <b>FreeBSD-14.0-RC4-amd64-bootonly.iso</b> to a virtual machine.<br>
Then, as `root` user, type the following:
```
cd ~
pkg install gcc git gmake
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Wind4/vlmcsd
cd vlmcsd
gmake
cd bin
```
The `vlmcsd` file is in the `~/vlmcsd/bin` folder.
